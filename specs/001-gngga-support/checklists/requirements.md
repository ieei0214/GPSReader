# Specification Quality Checklist: GNGGA NMEA Sentence Support

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-25
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

All checklist items pass. The specification is complete and ready for planning or clarification phase.

**Validation Details**:
- Content Quality: Specification focuses on what GNGGA support delivers to users (multi-GNSS receiver compatibility) without mentioning C#, .NET, or specific class implementations in the requirements sections
- Requirements: All 10 functional requirements are testable and clearly stated. Each has clear success/failure conditions
- Success Criteria: All 5 criteria are measurable (e.g., "100% of valid sentences", "within 0.0001 decimal degrees", "within 100 milliseconds") and technology-agnostic (describe outcomes from user perspective)
- Acceptance Scenarios: Each user story has 3-4 Given-When-Then scenarios covering happy path, edge cases, and error handling
- Edge Cases: 5 edge cases identified covering invalid data, field count variations, mixed sentence streams, parser identification, and invalid coordinate formats
- Scope: Clear boundaries - GNGGA parsing only, following existing patterns, with unit tests and console display
- Assumptions: 6 assumptions documented including GNGGA/GPGGA structural equivalence, coordinate conversion reuse, simultaneous support, architecture compatibility, UI framework, and testing approach
